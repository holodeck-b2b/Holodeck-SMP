# Holodeck SMP Interfaces

This module contains the interfaces that are needed to build custom extensions to add functionality to the standard
Holodeck SMP implementation.

**NOTE**: The license used for this module differs from the other modules that are part of the main Holodeck SMP
project as this module is licensed under the Lesser GPL v3 licence.
The reason for the different licensing is to make clear that you *can* develop closed source custom extensions for
Holodeck SMP - as long as you only use the interfaces as provided in this module.
