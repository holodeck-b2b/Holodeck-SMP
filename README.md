# Holodeck SMP Server
Holodeck SMP Server is a _service meta-data publisher_ that provides _capability_ information of _Participants_ in a data exchange network. It is commonly used in four-corner networks, such as [Peppol](https://peppol.org) and the [Business Payments Coalitionâ€™s (BPC) E-invoice Exchange Market Pilot](https://businesspaymentscoalition.org/) to find the _Access Point_ of the _Service Provider_ that handles the exchange of documents, like invoices and orders, on behalf of the _Participant_.
The current version supports the OASIS Standard [Service Metadata Publishing (SMP) version 2.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/bdxr/bdx-smp/v2.0/os/bdx-smp-v2.0-os.html) as used by the Business Payments Coalation (BPC) and the [Peppol specification](https://docs.peppol.eu/edelivery/smp/PEPPOL-EDN-Service-Metadata-Publishing-1.2.0-2021-02-24.pdf). It  also supports basic integration with the Peppol SML and Peppol Directory.

The server application available for download contains two separated interfaces, a REST based API for responding to queries and a web-based user interface for managing of the Participant's capabilities. By separating the query and management interfaces it is easy to manage access to them independently. Optionally a REST API for managing Participants can be added.
